      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "    There are two standard representations of time.  One is the number\n",
      "    of seconds since the Epoch, in UTC (a.k.a. GMT).  It may be an integer\n",
      "    or a floating point number (to represent fractions of seconds).\n",
      "    The Epoch is system-defined; on Unix, it is generally January 1st, 1970.\n",
      "    The actual value can be retrieved by calling gmtime(0).\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The other representation is a tuple of 9 integers giving local time.\n",
      "    The tuple items are:\n",
      "      year (including century, e.g. 1998)\n",
      "      month (1-12)\n",
      "      day (1-31)\n",
      "      hours (0-23)\n",
      "      minutes (0-59)\n",
      "      seconds (0-59)\n",
      "      weekday (0-6, Monday is 0)\n",
      "      Julian day (day in the year, 1-366)\n",
      "      DST (Daylight Savings Time) flag (-1, 0 or 1)\n",
      "    If the DST flag is 0, the time is given in the regular time zone;\n",
      "    if it is 1, the time is given in the DST time zone;\n",
      "    if it is -1, mktime() should guess based on the date and time.\n",
